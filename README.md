# e-commerce

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
This project is just the backend of an E-Commerce app. This would essentially help a storefront keep track of product inventory. I built this project to get more familiar with Sequalize and using an ORM approach. This helps keep better track of the associations among products, categories, and tags.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
